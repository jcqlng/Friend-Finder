# FriendFinder
The friend finder app is a compatibility test based on a 10 question survey that the user will respond to. The answer to the questions range from 1 (strongly disagree) through 5 (strongly agree). Once the survey is submitted, a friend from the user data will pop up in a module based on the user's response by matching the scores.
